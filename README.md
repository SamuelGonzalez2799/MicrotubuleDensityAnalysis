# MicrotubuleDensityAnalysis
## About the project
The goal of this script is to analyze the max intensity projections of the microtubule density within cells. The input for the code are max intensity projections in RGB of labelled microtubules within cells (the code assumes the microtubules are in the green channel, so this should be adjusted via imageJ before loading into the code).
